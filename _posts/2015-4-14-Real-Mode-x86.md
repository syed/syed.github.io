title: Real mode in x86 
---

I am planning to write a bunch of posts about memory and x86 architecture and
virtualization. This is the first post among hopefully many which will deep
dive into the x86 architecture. 

In this post I will cover about the real mode which is the simplest mode that
x86 works on.
