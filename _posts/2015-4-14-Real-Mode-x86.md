title: Real mode in x86 
---

I am planning to write a bunch of posts about memory and x86 architecture and
virtualization. This is the first post among hopefully many which will deep
dive into the x86 architecture. 

In this post I will cover about the real mode which is the default mode that
x86 runs in when it boots up. This was the default mode before intel introduced
paging in the [80286](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/80286). In this mode, all
registers are 16 bits and the processor can adress upto 20-bits of address
space giving \\( 2^{20} -1 \\) addressable bytes. All the addresses are
directly mapped to physical memory with no protection. 

These 20-bit address are accessed using a combination of segment address and offset.
To get a physical address, the 16-bit segement address is sifted left 4 bits and 
a 16-bit offset is added to it making a total of 20-bit address.


Let us look at a sample instruction and see how it works in real mode.
