I am a first year PhD student at [McGill University](http://mcgill.ca). My research focus is
on cloud computing specifically, working on challeneges involing multi-cloud deployments.

My supervisor is [Muthucumaru Maheswaran](http://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~maheswar/) who heads the
[Advanced Networking Resarch Lab](http://cgi.cs.mcgill.ca/~anrl/doku.php) at McGill.
